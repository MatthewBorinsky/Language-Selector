# Language Selector
## CS4482 Tools 2
### Matthew Borinsky
This adds a create language feature within the gameObject menu after right clicking.
It includes all current textboxes/sprites and gives prompts for what they should be in that instance.

It also has an ability to add textboxes using the Tools/Add String. 
You then have to map it in the example gameObject.
