# Language Selector
## CS4482 Tools 2
### Matthew Borinsky
This adds a create language feature within the gameObject menu after right clicking.
It includes all current textboxes/sprites and gives prompts for what they should be in that instance.
It also has an ability to add key-value pairs using the Tools/Add Key. 
The language values can be modified within each language scriptable object.
